# Outdoor and Indoor Positioning App

This repository is for **Outdoor and Indoor Positioning App** and i will try to update every now and then.

## Introduction

Android OS provides a location service application through Google Map. But indoor positioning is quite inaccurate. This Positioning Application uses stored Wi-Fi received signal strength to provide accurate positioning in indoor scenario and GPS to provide an accurate location in an outdoor scenario. A number of other extra features are available in this application, such as battery management information, image capture, compass and linear acceleration information.

## Operation of the Application

The application uses Wi-Fi signal and GPS to provide accurate location both indoor and outdoor scenario. Therefore, the user has to give permission to access location when installing the application on their android devices (with Android 6.0 or higher). The application may ask to activate GPS or Wi-Fi if it is turned off.
